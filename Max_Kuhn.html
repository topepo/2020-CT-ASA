# Goals for different types of models

.font120[
**Inferential models** are meant to produce explainable parameters of interested that can be quantified and compared statistically. The end goal is to make conclusions. 

**Predictive models** are created to produce predictions on new samples that are as close as possible to the actual values. Explainability is nice but secondary; the end goal is to estimate something accurately.  
]

The latter also goes by titles such as machine learning, AI, or pattern recognition.

# What we care about

.pull-left[
Inferential Models:

.font80[

* Dogmatic regarding probabilistic distributions.

* Bias towards explainable models (i.e., low-complexity).

  * Tend to be high bias/low variance models.

* Focus on likelihood-based statistics.

* Elimination of non-significant model terms. 

* Many different sub-models if the same type considered. 

* Uncertainty estimates

]

]
.pull-right[
Predictive Models:

.font80[

* Distribution ignorant (typically).

* Pro-complexity.

   * Variance and bias levels vary; stereotypically high variance/low bias. 

* Focus on accuracy-oriented metrics or business metrics (e.g., expected monetary loss).

* Feature selection and engineering are important. 

* Many different types of models considered. 

* What is this "uncertainty" thing you keep talking about? 

]

]

&lt;br&gt;

Both are subject to the [Garden of Forking Paths](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf) and p-hacking.

# How the model is validated in practice


.pull-left[
Inferential Models:

* Checking assumptions (e.g., residual analysis, EDA)

* Goodness of fit tests, overall ANOVA analysis, etc. 

* [Debatable] Conduct model selection until there are no insignificant predictors.

* With- and without-outlier re-analysis. 

]
.pull-right[
Predictive Models:

* Data splitting (training/test sets) 

* Resampling or validation sets during development, test set at end. 

* Visualization of predictions/residuals, EDA, detective work.

* Empirical assessments based on performance statistics.

# Where this _could_ go wrong

IMO inferential statistics has somewhat fetishized statistical significance and disregarded accuracy-based performance metrics. 

  * How many times have you seen percent accuracy been highlighted when reporting logistic regression results? 

Models with low _R_&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or poor accuracy presented with the same credence as one that performs well. 

If the _R_&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was 20%, does this mean that 80% of the inferences are questionable? 
 

---

# Objective functions 

Another issue is that statistical significance metrics are likelihood-based. This metric may not reflect how close the predictions are to the true values 

 * Except in ordinary linear regression. 
 
Friedman (2001): 

&gt; "degrading the likelihood by overfitting actually improves misclassification error rate. Although perhaps counterintuitive, this is not a contradiction; likelihood and error rate measure different aspects of fit quality."

I'm not arguing that statistical significance be thrown away in favor of accuracy measures. I think that the latter must qualify the former. 

There should be some proof that the model's results have some degree of fidelity to the data. QQ-plots on residuals aren't enough. 

---

# What's so great about predictive/ML models?

Probably the best thing that ML models have going for them is the focus on empirical validation. 

This usually involves computing performance on out-of-sample data.

 * Never naively re-predict the data use to build the model
 
 * For the training set, the re-predicted data contain favorable biases. 

 * These biases grow as the model becomes more complex. 
 
To paraphrase Fury (2014) "[empirical validation] takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be." 


---

# Resampling

The best tool for empirical validation is _resampling_. 

It iteratively separates the data into two partitions; one is used for modeling and another to measure performance. 

Without throwing away data, it does the best job of finding performance estimates (of anything) that generalize to the sample population. 

Examples are cross-validation, the bootstrap, rolling forecast origin resampling, and others. 

 * These mostly differ in how the data are partitioned. 

The next slide has a general schematic for resampling; however, for inferential models, a test set probably is not needed.

# Example: orthodontic measurement

Data are from Potthoff and Roy (1964) and are used by just about everyone:

&gt; Investigators at the University of North Carolina Dental School followed the growth of 27 children (16 males, 11 females) from age 8 until age 14. Every two years they measured the distance between the pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure, two points that are easily identified on x-ray exposures of the side of the head.

We are modeling a subject's distances as a function of the age and gender. 

(data are in the `nlme` package)

# Modeling Strategy

A linear model for `age` with subject-specific slopes and intercepts seems reasonable for these data. 

We'll fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with: 

 * t(1) priors or regression coefficients, 
 * Gaussian errors with a prior of expo(1) for `\(\sigma\)`, 
 * 8 chains with 2000 iterations/chain.

I fit the models using Stan via R. 

We'll look at models with random slopes, random intercepts, and both as random. 

Sex will be used as a fixed effect. 

.code90[

```r
both_param  =  age * Sex + (  age   | Subject)
slopes_only =  age * Sex + (0 + age | Subject)
int_only    =  age * Sex + (  1     | Subject)
```

These are from re-predicting the same data used to build the model.

# Resampling

For these data, the most natural resampling method is _leave-subject-out cross-validation_. 

 * For 27 iterations, one subject is withheld and the model is fit using the other subjects. 
 
 * For each subject, RMSE and _R_&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are computed on their predictions. 
 
The resampling estimate is the average of the 27 assessment set statistics. 

Recall that, for multi-level models, a new subject would be predicted using the the posterior mode estimates of the regression parameters. 

 * Since no other subject-specific covariates are in this model, the same predicted values are used for all _new_ subjects being exposed to the model. 
 
How do the resampled estimates compare to the posterior distribution?

# Which RMSE estimate do we believe? 

This demonstrates that within-sample statistics may give us optimistic assessments of performance. 

 * Without resampling, each sample's profile is estimated with shrunken slopes and intercepts. 

 * With resampling, the estimates are integrated over subjects. 

Since subject is a _random effect_, there is the notation that we want our inferences to be generalizable to the population of subjects 

 * As opposed to having inferences that are specific to _these particular_ subjects (i.e. as a _fixed effect_). 

From this point of view, the poor performance is the more realistic estimate of the model RMSE.  

If there were subject-specific covariates, this might have turned out better.

# Comparing models using resampling

Since we have _matched_ resampling statistics across models and resamples, these can be used as the _data_ in an ANOVA model. 

From this model, formal inferences can be made regarding differences in model metrics (e.g. R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc). 

One issue is that there is typically a strong within-resample correlation (usually &gt; 0.5). 

A hierarchical model can be used to model this variance effect. 

This idea is based off of the ideas in Hothorn _et al_ (2005),  Eugster _et al_ (2006), and Benavoli _et al_ (2017). 

Software to automate this is in the `tidyposterior` package. 


---

# A reasonable hierarchical model

Having looked at a lot of these types of results, a random intercept model seems most appropriate: 

`$$y_{ij} = (\beta_0 + b_{i}) + \beta_1x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_px_{ip} + \epsilon_{ij}$$`

where `\(i\)` is over _resamples_, `\(j\)` is over _models_ and the outcome data are the performance statistics. 

The Central Limit Theorem tends to kick in fairly quickly; normality for `\(\epsilon\)` can often work. In other cases, a transformation for the `\(y_{ij}\)` can stabilize the variance. 

From this model, posteriors for differences in performance ( `\(\delta_{jj'} = \beta_j - \beta_{j'}\)` ) can be computed and visualized.

From this analysis, the resample-to-resample variation was 99.9%  of the total variance.

.pull-right[
There is a 50% probability that the slope only model is better. 

The size of the difference, -0.00003961, is not practically important. 

 * This can be quantified better using Regions of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) estimates. 
 
These results aren't surprising since the subject-specific slope and intercept estimates are highly correlated.
